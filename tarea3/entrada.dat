Huffman code is a lookup table thats generated by a compression scheme known as the Huffman algorithm. While the table itself is only a part of the complete algorithm, its probably the most challenging component to grasp. It is a binary tree that stores values based on frequency. 
The more frequent the value, the closer to the root it is located and the smaller its binary representation. Once the lookup table is created, it is used to compress the data, and subsequently to decompress it.
